cd local-lend-final
2. Backend SetupNavigate to the server directory:cd server
Install the required npm packages:npm install
Set up the PostgreSQL database:Create a new database named locallend_final.Connect to the new database and run the SQL commands found in server/database.sql (or from the guide) to create the users and items tables.Create a .env file in the server directory to store your environment variables. The server code will need to be updated to use a library like dotenv to read this file.DB_USER=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=locallend_final
DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
DB_PORT=5432
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_that_is_long_and_random
(Note: The provided guide hardcodes these values. For better security, modify server/index.js to use process.env.VARIABLE_NAME after installing dotenv).Start the backend server:npm start
The server should now be running on http://localhost:5001.3. Frontend SetupOpen a new terminal and navigate to the client directory:cd client
Install the required npm packages:npm install
Start the frontend React application:npm start
Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:3000.How to Use üìãUpon launching the application, you will be greeted with the Login page.If you are a new user, click the "Register here" link.Fill out the registration form with a username, email, and password.After successful registration, you will be redirected to the login page.Log in with your new credentials.You can now see all available items, add new items using the form, and borrow items from other users by clicking the "Borrow" button.
